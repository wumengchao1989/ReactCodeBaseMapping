ReactCodebaseMapping
--
- This mind map is a brief guidance of react codebase which is base on my recent learning experience.The source code is based on React version 15.6.<br/>
- It mainly has two branches,one is following the process of rendering an react component for the first time,while the other branch is about react's update process.<br/>
- This map is still under construction, and it will has mistakes or something important missing.<br/>
- The .xmind file can only be opened and edited by XMind,so I also provide output pdf file for convenience.

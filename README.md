ReactCodebaseMapping
--
This mind map is a brief guidance of react codebase which is base on my recent learning experience.<br/>
It mainly has two branches,one is following the process of rendering an react component for the first time,while the other branch is about react's update process.<br/>
This map is still under construction, and it will has mistakes or something important missing.
The .xmind file can only be opened and edited by XMind,so I also provide output pdf file for convenience.
